    This was a project for class in order to build a investment calculator for a bank client using best practices and safety standards. Following guildlines and rubrics set out by the client.

    I was able to follow the documents and specifications for syntax with precision and got the exact output required.
  
    I could make my code more modular and reusable. Which would create easier implementation and scaleability over time.
    
    Making sure I followed documentation and specifications exactly were what I had the biggest challenge with. I have added Obsidian note taking app to my resources.
    
    Being able to work from a document and create software using best practices is a skill that seems like it will be extremely helpful in the workforce.
